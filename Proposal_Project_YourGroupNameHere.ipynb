    "# Abstract \n",
    "For our final project, we aim to develop a chess-playing AI using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm commonly used for continuous decision-making in complex environments like chess. The goal is to train an agent capable of making optimal chess moves based on learned strategies through trial and error rather than pre-programmed heuristics. Our chess bot will interact with an environment based on gym-chess to improve through self-play and reinforcement learning. Success will be measured using multiple performance metrics, including decision efficiency in game situations, evaluation of how powerful a certain move was, and of course, overall win-loss ratio. We will also assess learning stability by tracking reward progression over training episodes and will design a unique reward function that balances material advantage (when a player has more valuable pieces than their opponent), positional strength, and long-term strategic play to ensure optimal decision-making in various game scenarios. Through model tuning and iterative training, we hope to develop a competitive chess bot that is capable of making intelligent, high-quality moves."

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",
